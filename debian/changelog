skippy-xd (0.5.1~hg20111223-1~precise~ppa3) precise; urgency=low

  * Install config example skippy-xd.rc-default to /usr/share/skippy-xd .
  * Install skippy-xd-activate convenience wrapper that runs 
    'sleep 0.15 && skippy-xd --activate-window-picker', which introduces
    a small delay before activating the daemon and hopefully improves
    reliability.
  * Install skippy-xd-restart convenience wrapper that can be used to 
    quickly restart the daemon in case it crashes.
  * touch skippy-xd.rc-default to avoid "time stamp too far in the past"
    Launchpad upload error.
